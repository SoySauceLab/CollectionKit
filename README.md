### Features

* Rewritten `UICollectionView` on top of `UIScrollView`.
* Automatically diff data changes and update UI.
* Superb performance through cell reuse, batched reload, visible-only diff, & the use of swift value types.
* Builtin layout & animation systems specifically built for collections.
* Composable sections with independent layout.
* Strong type checking powered by Swift Generics.

### CollectionView

`CollectionView` is CollectionKit's alternative to `UICollectionView`. You give it a `CollectionProvider` object that tells `CollectionView` how to display & handle a collection.

Provider is easy to construct and composable as well. You can combine multiple providers together and easily create sections within a single `CollectionView`. Each provider can also have its own layout and presenter.

### Layout System

CollectionKit implements its own powerful layout system. Each provider can have its own layout. You can also specify a layout when combining multiple providers together. CollectionKit provides some of the common layouts out of the box, but you can also create your own layout.

* **FlowLayout** - better `UICollectionFlowLayout` - supports `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, & `alignContent`
* **WaterfallLayout** - a pinterest like waterfall layout
* **RowLayout** - a single row flowlayout that allows cell to fill up empty spaces.
* **InsetLayout** - adds extra padding around a existing layout
* **TransposeLayout** - rotate an existing layout. (vertical to horizontal or vice versa)
* **OverlayLayout** - overlay items on top of each other.

### Presenter System

CollectionKit offers a presenter system which allows you to create fancy animations and adjust how cells are displayed. Presenter can be applied to individual providers, cells, or to entire `CollectionView`.

Here are some examples of custom presenters that is included in the example project. Note that they can be used in combination with any layout. Here we are using a transposed waterfall layout.

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

Presenter can also perform animations when a cell is added/moved/deleted. Here is an example showing a 3d scale animation with a cascading effect.

#### Please checkout the example project to see many of these examples in action.

## Install

**CocoaPods**
```ruby
pod "CollectionKit"
```

**Carthage**
```
github "SoySauceLab/CollectionKit"
```

## Usage

To build a basic provider, here is what you need:

```swift
let provider1 = CollectionProvider(
    data: [1，2，3, 4], // provide an array of data, data can be any type
    viewUpdater: { (label: UILabel, data: Int, index: Int) in
        // update your view according to your data, view can be any subclass of UIView
        label.backgroundColor = .red
        label.layer.cornerRadius = 8
        label.textAlignment = .center
        label.text = "\(data)"
    },
    sizeProvider: { (index: Int, data: Int, collectionSize: CGSize) -> CGSize in
        return CGSize(width: 50, height: 50) // return your cell size
    }
)
```

To display the content, just assign this provider to any instance of `CollectionView`.

```swift
collectionView.provider = provider1
```

### Composing & Layout

Use `CollectionComposer` to combine multiple providers into one. You can also supply layout objects to Provider & Composer.

```swift
provider1.layout = FlowLayout(spacing: 10)

let provider2 = CollectionProvider(
    data: ["A", "B"],
    viewUpdater: { (label: UILabel, data: String, index: Int) in
        label.backgroundColor = .blue
        label.layer.cornerRadius = 8
        label.textAlignment = .center
        label.text = data
    },
    layout: FlowLayout(spacing: 10),
    sizeProvider: { (index: Int, data: String, collectionSize: CGSize) -> CGSize in
        return CGSize(width: 230, height: 50)
    }
)

collectionView.provider = CollectionComposer(
    layout: FlowLayout(spacing: 20, justifyContent: .center, alignItems: .center),
    provider1,
    provider2
)
```

### Apply Presenter

```swift
// apply to the entire CollectionView
collectionView.presenter = WobblePresenter()

// apply to a single section, will override CollectionView's presenter
provider1.presenter = WobblePresenter()

// apply to a single view, will take priority over all other presenters
view.collectionPresenter = WobblePresenter()
```
